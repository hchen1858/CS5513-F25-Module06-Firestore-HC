I saw my friend Mochi the Maine Coon cat over the backyard fence today.
He is a paragon of Maine Coon cats, with the two main characteristics of his breed.
 
- **Largest Non-Hyrbrid Domestic Cat Breed** Mochi is a huge 22 lb giant who is 15 inches tall at the shoulder.

- **Polydactylism** Mochi has huge paws, one of which has seven toes!
